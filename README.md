Project Description: For our ORIE 4741 Big Messy Data team project, we will be analyzing social media and stock market data in order to predict future stock prices. During our first meeting, we wondered if there were any correlation between the number of daily references of a company within social media and its stock price. Then, we decided to pursue our team project as a stock prediction model based on the social media data. We will be examining data such as number of daily references(i.e. post, comments) within different platforms,aggregate of the number of likes on posts for each companies, and etc. Rather than looking at the entire market, we wil be only focusing on few specific companies within the technology sector, and we will use the APIs from twitter and reddit as we thought those two were the most appropriate platform to get data from.
